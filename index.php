          <p style="color: beige; padding-left: 60px; padding-top: 20px; font-weight: 600;">According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species – the world’s most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species – at least 37% of the world’s sharks and rays, 33% of reef corals, 26% of mammals (including marine) and 21% of reptiles are threatened with extinction. Many of these species live in oceans and marine environments, but overfishing, habitat loss and degradation, pollution, as well as climate change, have plagued many animals to the brink of extinction. These are just 11 examples of the most endangered species in the ocean that are in urgent need of protection.

          <p style="color: azure;">The twilight zone, also known as the mesopelagic zone, is a layer in the ocean between 200 and 1,000 meters deep where sunlight is dim but not completely absent. Many species have adapted to this low-light environment, including lanternfish, bristle mouths, squids, jellyfish, and zooplankton. Some are even bioluminescent, using their own light for communication, predation, and camouflage. </p>

            <h2 style="color: aliceblue;">vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis)</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large; color: aliceblue;">The    sanguine      coloration   of   vampire   squid   earned   them   a     nickname    inspired     by    the    undead    bloodsuckers      of    lore, with a cape-like webbing of skin between their arms to boot. They aren’t immortal, but their lifespan is longer than most cephalopods because they live at a slower pace, inhabiting the open ocean at depths of 500 to 3,000 meters (1,600 to 9,800 feet).</p><br>
           <p style="font-size: large; color: aliceblue;"> At this depth, life is less about swimming and more about floating, which means only needing a little oxygen and getting by on a low-calorie diet of zooplankton and miscellaneous detritus. Vampire squid also have a more active sex life compared to most cephalopods, having multiple reproductive cycles while other species have just one.  </p>

          <h2 style="color: aliceblue;"> Barreleye (Macropinna)</h2>
          <p style="font-size: large; color: aliceblue;"> Found at depths most light can't reach, these truly bizarre animals are equipped with a see-through head, allowing their eyes to effectively look out of the sunroof as they navigate the pitch-black waters.The barreleye’s eyes aren’t those two indentations you see in the conventional eye position, but are actually the glowy green balls sitting slightly further back. The circles at the front are olfactory organs that can “smell” chemical cues in the water. You can see a living barreleye swimming here.</p><br>
           <p style="font-size: large; color: aliceblue;"> The function of the eyes’ strange positioning, MBARI says, is to spy prey above them, which they’ll sometimes steal from the dangling tentacles of siphonophores. As ultra-sensitive tubular eyes, they are incredibly well adapted for spotting the silhouettes of edible animals against the minuscule amount of light that travels to such depths. At one point, it was thought the barreleye’s eyes were constantly to the sky, but it’s since been established that they can roll to face forwards when eating.</p>

          <h2 style="color: aliceblue;"> deepsea  dragonfish (Stomidae)</h2>
          <p style="font-size: large; color:white;">Measuring just 15 centimeters (6 inches) in length, the dragonfish (Aristostomias scintillans) has an “enormous” jaw relative to their size, capable of extending and opening beyond the abilities of a conventional jaw. It’s also lined with dozens of fang-like teeth sharper than those found in a piranha. To keep their prey in the dark, the teeth of dragonfish have evolved a transparent structure that essentially makes their fearsome mouth invisible.</p><br>
          <p style="font-size: large; color: azure;">Dragonfish have small photophores that generate light for attracting prey, but with such big teeth, they’d risk giving the game away if their spiky gnashers reflected that light. Research has shown that they’ve evolved transparent teeth to overcome this, meaning they’re both excellent predators and master hiders.

    <h2 style="color: aliceblue;">Deep-sea anglerfish</h2>
    <p style="font-size : large; color: aliceblue;">The anglerfish are ray-finned fish in the order Lophiiformes. Both the order's common and scientific name comes from the characteristic mode of predation, in which a modified dorsal fin ray acts as a lure for prey (akin to a human angler, and likened to a crest or "lophos"). The modified fin ray, with the very tip being the esca and the length of the structure the illicium, is adapted to attract specific prey items across the families of anglerfish by using different luring methods.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: large; color:aliceblue;">Anglerfish are notable for their sexual dimorphism, which is sometimes extremely pronounced; the males may be several orders of magnitude smaller in mass than females. This dimorphism has enabled a unique reproductive method in the deep-sea anglerfish; sexual parasitism is the attachment of male to the much larger female, sometimes fusing together as an example of natural parabiosis.</p>
